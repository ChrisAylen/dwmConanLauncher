# dwmConanLauncher

This application will lookup the IP associated with "deadmengaming.co.uk" by default.  

To Install:

Plase the exe in a dedicated folder of your choice.

To Use:
1) Launch the binary (LaunchGame.exe)
2) Enter a password, and optionally, save it.  This will create a config.txt file in the same folder as the launcher that holds the password in plain text.
3) Press 'Launch'
4) Steam will the present a dialog "Allow game launch".  You may need to locate this dialog and press 'ok'.

From this point on the launch process should be as flakey as usual.
